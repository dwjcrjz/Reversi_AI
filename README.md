Alpha_Beta and evalution

reversi1.py is the first version

reversi2.py is more powerful cause the evalution is better

reversi3.py is the final version of this project, I added hash table, and iterative deepening to improve its efficiency 

The evalution consider stable, corner, x position, c posiotion, stable line, mobility, inside and outside.
